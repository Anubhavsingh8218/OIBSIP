# Java Projects – Oasis Infobyte Internship

This repository contains two core Java-based console applications developed as part of my internship at **Oasis Infobyte**. These projects demonstrate foundational skills in Java programming, including user input handling, control flow, exception handling, and object-oriented design.

## Projects Included

### 1. ATM Interface 💳
A console-based simulation of an ATM system that allows a user to:
- Register and log in securely
- View balance and transaction history
- Withdraw, deposit, and transfer money
- Exit the session securely

📂 **File**: [`ATMInterface.java`](ATMInterface.java)  
🛠 **Concepts used**: Classes & Objects, User Input (`Scanner`), Conditional Logic, Loops

### 2. Number Guessing Game 🎯
A fun terminal game where:
- The program generates a random number within a range
- The user is given multiple chances to guess the number
- Score is tracked, and the number of attempts is limited

📂 **File**: [`numGuess.java`](numGuess.java)  
🛠 **Concepts used**: Random Number Generation, Loops, Conditional Logic, Exception Handling

## Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 8+)
- IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code (Recommended IDEs)
- Command Line Interface

## Internship Acknowledgment

These projects were created as part of my Java Development Internship at Oasis Infobyte, where I gained hands-on experience in developing interactive Java applications.
